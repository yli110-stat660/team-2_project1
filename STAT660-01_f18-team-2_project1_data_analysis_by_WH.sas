This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding the absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a 
counrier company in Brazil.

Dataset Name: Absenteeism_at_work created in external file
STAT660_f18-team-2_project1_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file.

See included file for dataset properties
;

* environmental setup;

* set relative file import path to current directory (using standard SAS trick);
X "cd ""%substr(%sysget(SAS_EXECFILEPATH),1,%eval(%length(%sysget(SAS_EXECFILEPATH))-%length(%sysget(SAS_EXECFILENAME))))""";

title1
'Research Question:  What was the most common reason for the absenteesim?'

;

title2
'Rationale: This would help to find out whether most of the workers were havign the same reason for absenteesim. '

;

footnote1
'Based on the summary table, the most common reason was medical consultation(23).'

;

footnote2
'After grouping by ID, we could find the most common reason for absence for each employee.For example, employee 28 used reason 23 for 32 times.'

;

*
Methodology: Used proc freq to find the frequency of each reason, 
using the result to find out the most common one.

Limitations: Since each employee had multiple reasons,it would 
be better give same weight to each employee for more accurate results.

Follow-up Steps: Add weight to the frequency count.

title1
'Research Question: What are the reasons with longer absenteeism hours?'

;

title2
'Rationale: This should help to have a general understanding of how many absenteeism hours related with each reason.'

;

footnote1
'Based on the summary table, diseases of the circulatory system had the longest average absenteeism hours which is 42 hours. '

;

footnote2
'The the average of absenteeism time in hours is only 6.99 hours.'

;

footnote3
'This could tell us there would be a high chance that a employee who takes absence for the reason of circulatory system would have a longer absenttesim time.' 

;
*
Methodology: Use PROC MEANS to find out the average absenteeism 
hours for each reason.

Limitations: There may be duplicates in the dataset.

Follow-up Steps: Add a week_number as a new column to the dataset 
if possible.Then use id, absenteeism_time_in_hours, Day_of_the_week,
week_number,month_of_absence,reason_for_absence as a composite key.

title1
'Research Question: Is there a special day in a week that employees might be absent? '

;

title2
'Rationale: In reality, it would help with weekly work schedule.'

;

footnote1
'Based on the summary table, the frequency of each work day in a week is from 19%-22.34% which are round 20%.'

;

footnote2
'Although day 2 of the week had a bit higher frequency of 22.34%,hypothesis testing will be needed for significance difference test if we are interested in it.'

;

footnote3
'Genreally speaking,employees take absence with no preferrence on days. But there could be a special patterns if analyzed by months or seasons.'

;

*
Methodology: Use proc freq to study the weekly pattern for each season. Count the
Absenteeism_time_in hours where value is not 0.Crosstable with ID 
is also used to find out the week pattern of each employee.

Limitations: In special month or season, it may have special daily distribution.

Follow-up Steps:Check this pattern in a special month or season when needed.
